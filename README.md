Lingo for Android mobile devices

A random four-letter word is selected from the dictionary for the player to guess. The player gets 8 guesses. When a guess is inputted, letters in the guess that are in the random word and are in the same position in the word are colored yellow, and letters that are in the guess but are in a different position in the word are colored blue, and letters not in the random word are colored white. The player must use the new information they receive from the guesses to uncover all the letters in the hidden word in the correct positions.
